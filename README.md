# Classic Windows #

## What is Classic Windows? ##

Classic Windows is a very simple app that runs in your status bar, and enables the Classic Mac OS behavior of bringing all of an application's windows to the front when you click on one.

## Why does this exist? ##

After John Siracusa's explanation of his... unique window management system on the [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/episodes/96), I was intrigued. Especially when in [a later episode](http://atp.fm/episodes/98) he described a very important component; when he clicks on a window for any application, all of the application's windows come to the front over other apps, emulating Classic Mac OS behavior.

Curious, I went to try it for myself. Sadly, most of the utilities that enabled this functionality seem to have been all but abandoned. [DragThing](http://www.dragthing.com/) and [X-Assist](http://www.ortabe.com/downloads/) were the only apps I found that enabled this functionality without issue, but X-Assist hasn't been updated since 2008. I didn't really want to shell out for a $30 license for DragThing just for this functionality, so I decided to try writing it myself.

And, after one sleepless night, I had a first attempt up and running.

This is my first real attempt at a Mac application, as well as my excuse to learn Swift, so please bear with me.
